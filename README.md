## Data Retrieval:
The data used for this project was found in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus webpage from the Department of Laboratory Medicine Shunde Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine in 2022.
Since I had complications with the data calling, the data can be found in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Masaam2000/Data_reexam.git. The code that will be used, already considers the data from that specific personal repository.

## How to run this project:

To successfully run the project and all its code and obtain all results including the html files, plots and the presentation, please do the following:
1.  Make sure that the data is still available in the personal respoitory (it should be).
2.  Find the file 00_all.qmd inside the "R" folder.
3.  Open the 00_all.qmd and run all the code inside.
4.  You should now have all results generated and saved.
